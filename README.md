# TiDB Cloud Data Service Guide

TiDB Cloud is a powerful and user-friendly cloud-based database platform. This comprehensive guide aims to offer detailed instructions on leveraging the TiDB Cloud Data Service to construct a straightforward dashboard app using less than 100 lines of code.

To begin with, you can refer to the Data Service documentation and try out the online demo to gain familiarity with the platform.

- [Access the Data Service Documentation for more information](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/data-service-overview)
- [Check out the online demo of the dashboard app](https://data-service-example.vercel.app/)

## Prepare the data source

Before you can start building your dashboard app, you need to prepare your environment. You can do this by signing in to TiDB Cloud and creating a free Serverless Cluster. Simply access [the TiDB Cloud website](https://tidbcloud.com/), sign in using your Google or GitHub account, and click the "Create Cluster" button. Select the "Serverless" option to generate a free cluster that automatically scales based on your usage.

Once your cluster is set up, you can begin exploring the sample data provided by TiDB Cloud. This sample dataset includes a table called `sold_car_orders`, which stores information about car orders. We will use this table to construct the dashboard app.

## Build APIs

Our dashboard includes the following data:

- Annual sales of car orders for the past years and the average selling price for all orders in those years(line chart)
- Top 10 car brands and models with the highest sales order count and highest selling price for a given year(item list)

This can be done by 4 corresponding APIs:

- GET `/total_order_per_year`
- GET `/avg_price_per_year`
- GET `/order_by_brand_year?year=${year}`
- GET `/price_by_brand_year?year=${year}`

Using the TiDB Cloud **Data Service**, we can easily create and deploy these APIs with just a few clicks.

> The first two APIs are straightforward and if needed, you can also get help from the AI feature, simply type "-- [your question text here]" then hit the `Enter` key to try out these AI-generated SQL queries.

```sql
-- GET `/total_order_per_year`
use sample_data;

SELECT
  `year`,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM
  `sold_car_orders`
GROUP BY
  `year`
ORDER BY
  `year`;

-- GET `/avg_price_per_year`
use sample_data;

SELECT
  `year`,
  AVG(`selling_price`) AS avg_price_per_year
FROM
  `sample_data`.`sold_car_orders`
GROUP BY
  `year`
ORDER BY
  `year`;
```

You can click the `Deploy` button in the upper right corner to deploy them to the public network and use the command provided in the `Code Example` to test them. Of course, to protect the security of the API, you need to create a pair of keys for authentication, which can be easily configured by clicking on your DataApp.

The next two APIs require dynamic parameter injection. We can use syntax like `${year}` to represent them and pass in given values in the Params panel on the right for testing. For GET APIs, these parameters need to be passed in through the query in the URL, while for POST APIs, they need to be included in the request body as JSON strings.

```sql
-- GET `/order_by_brand_year`
use sample_data;

SELECT
  name,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM
  `sold_car_orders`
WHERE
  `year` = ${year}
GROUP BY
  `name`
ORDER BY
  order_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- GET `/price_by_brand_year`
use sample_data;

SELECT DISTINCT
  `name`,
  `selling_price` as `price`
FROM
  `sold_car_orders`
WHERE
  `year` = ${year}
ORDER BY
  `selling_price` DESC
LIMIT
  10;
```

## Build the front-end

Next, we'll implement the front-end using Next.js and deploy it conveniently via Vercel. To initialize the project, use the `npx create-next-app@latest` command. Once complete, create a `.env` file in the root directory to specify some environment variables that shouldn't be hardcoded in the source code and can be easily changed on-the-fly:

```
TIDBCLOUD_DATA_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY=PUBLIC_KEY
TIDBCLOUD_DATA_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY=PRIVATE_KEY
TIDBCLOUD_DATA_SERVICE_HOST=https://us-east-1.data.tidbcloud.com/api/v1beta/app/dataapi-xxxxxx/endpoint/v1
```

This will enable us to pass these variables through the `with-digest-fetch` library to safely authenticate API requests:

```js
import DigestFetch from "with-digest-fetch";

const client = new DigestFetch(
  process.env.TIDBCLOUD_DATA_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY!,
  process.env.TIDBCLOUD_DATA_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY!
);
client.fetch(...)
```

To work around cross-origin restrictions, let's create a forwarding API interface using Next.js API router. Create an `api/gateway/[path].ts` file under the `pages` folder, and extract the corresponding `path` parameter from incoming requests to forward them to the appropriate TiDB Cloud Data Service API.

```ts
const fetcher = async (key: string, body?: Record<string, any>) => {
  const url = `${process.env.TIDBCLOUD_DATA_SERVICE_HOST}/${key}`;
  const res = await client.fetch(url, {
    body: body ? JSON.stringify(body) : body,
  });
  return await res.json();
};

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { path, ...rest } = req.query;

  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams();
  for (const key in rest) {
    searchParams.append(key, rest[key] as string);
  }
  const url =
    Object.keys(rest).length > 0
      ? `${path}?${searchParams.toString()}`
      : (path as string);

  const response = await fetcher(url);
  res.status(200).json(response);
}
```

Now, it's time to focus on the implementation of the front-end code for the browser. Once we retrieve the correct data through the API, we will use `Chart.js` to render them.

Check the component code in `pages/index.tsx`. For ease of calling the API in React, we use the library `swr` as follows:

```ts
const fetcher: Fetcher<any, any> = (
  input: RequestInfo | URL,
  init?: RequestInit
) => globalThis.fetch(input, init).then((res) => res.json());

const { data: orderByYearData } = useSWR(
  `/api/gateway/order_per_year`,
  fetcher as Fetcher<OrderByYearData, string>
);
const { data: avgPriceByYearData } = useSWR(
  `/api/gateway/avg_price_per_year`,
  fetcher as Fetcher<AvgPriceByYearData, string>
);
const { data: orderByBrandYearData } = useSWR(
  `/api/gateway/order_by_brand_year?year=${year}`,
  fetcher as Fetcher<OrderByBrandYearData, string>
);
const { data: topPriceByYearData } = useSWR(
  `/api/gateway/price_by_brand_year?year=${year}`,
  fetcher as Fetcher<TopPriceByYearData, string>
);
```

After retrieving the data, we configure some options for the chart, then pass in the data to render the desired line chart:

```tsx
const options = {
  responsive: true,
  plugins: {
    legend: {
      position: "top" as const,
    },
    title: {
      display: true,
      text: "Car Sales Trend",
    },
  },
};

const labels = orderByYearData?.data.rows.map((i) => i.year);
const datasets = [
  {
    data: orderByYearData?.data.rows.map((i) => Number(i.order_count)),
    label: "Number of Orders",
    borderColor: "rgb(53, 162, 235)",
    backgroundColor: "rgba(53, 162, 235, 0.5)",
  },
  {
    data: avgPriceByYearData?.data.rows.map((i) =>
      Math.round(Number(i.price) / 1000)
    ),
    label: "Average Selling Price (K)",
    borderColor: "rgb(255, 99, 132)",
    backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)",
  },
];

//render
<Line options={options} data={{ labels, datasets }} />;
```

For the remaining two datasets showing the top 10 rankings, we will not use a chart, but instead, directly display them in a list:

```tsx
function RankList(data: { value: number; name: string }[]) {
  return (
    <>
      {data.map((i, index, array) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <div title={i.name}>{i.name}</div>
          <div>{i.value.toLocaleString("en-US")}</div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RankList
        data={
          orderByBrandYearData?.data.rows.slice(0, 10).map((i) => ({
            name: i.name,
            value: Number(i.order_count),
          })) ?? []
        }
      />

      <RankList
        data={
          topPriceByYearData?.data.rows.slice(0, 10).map((i) => ({
            name: i.name,
            value: Number(i.price),
          })) ?? []
        }
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

For selecting the year, we can declare a state and allow the user to modify this state through a selector:

```tsx
const [year, setYear] = useState("2017");

<div>
  <span>Year:</span>
  <select value={year} onChange={(e) => setYear(e.target.value)}>
    {labels?.map((i) => (
      <option key={i} value={i}>
        {i}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
</div>;
```

## Finish

Next, we can further optimize the styling to make the page more attractive. With this, we have completed the development of this dashboard!

By using TiDB Cloud Data Service, what would have been several days of extensive backend API development work can now be done in just a couple of minutes. Furthermore, users are not burdened with deployment and operation concerns. All that remains is to push the code to GitHub and, with a few clicks on vercel.com, our app is online!

You can view the complete source code on our [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/tidbcloud/data-service-example), or try out our online demo [here](https://data-service-example.vercel.app/).
